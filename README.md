This project implements a data structure to manage roads and bridges between two cities. 
It supports operations such as initializing the data structure with a given number of roads, 
adding bridges with specific heights to roads, 
finding the suitable road for a truck based on its height, 
and printing the heights of all bridges on a specified road. 
The system ensures efficient handling of road and bridge data to facilitate transportation planning and management.
